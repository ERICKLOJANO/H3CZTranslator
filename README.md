# [@H3CZenEspanol Bot](http://twitter.com/H3CZenEspanol)
By Erick Lojano

# About this Bot
* This bot was created with the sole purpose of translating tweets, specifically for [@H3CZ](http://twitter.com/h3cz). 

* My inspiration behind this bot was that one of my favorite YouTubers has a pretty big following of spanish speakers. Unfortunately @H3CZ isn't always able to reach out
to them. So I decided to help him out, and what better way then to translating someones thoughts!

# Current Status of this Bot
*8/6/2021*

At the moment, this bot is only able to run locally using ```node bot.js``` and it only translates my personal tweets, I will be looking into deployment and changing the
"handle" so it translates @H3CZ's tweets.

*8/7/2021*

Twitter bot has been deployed, and is currently replying to @HECZ

# Challenges I faced
* Making twitter bots isn't a fad anymore in the programming world, so following YouTube videos step by step isn't the best idea
* Twitter is always looking for ways to improve their API, so learning about the Twitter API v2 was interesting(not many videos on it)
